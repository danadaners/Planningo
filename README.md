Planningo

Planningo is an all-in-one, reward-based productivity/life management app. In Planningo, groups create and share collective to-do lists and calendars where they can assign tasks to one another and check on each otherâ€™s task-completion progress. To incentivize the completion of to-dos, users are rewarded in points. Planningo can be used by families, friends, roommates, and colleagues.

Team Members: Nadia Collado, Dana Zhang and Sally Yoo
